## The backstory
https://stuartfeeser.com/blogs/doge/index.html

I created this project out of frustrationâ€”too many opinions, not enough facts about the U.S. economy. I wanted a way to model economic systems using **math**, minimizing **emotion** and **bias** as much as possible.  

At the same time, I needed a way to explain my findings clearly. And, let's be honestâ€”I also wanted an excuse to try out **Grok**, having already experimented with ChatGPT and Meta's AI models as well as coauoring server of these AI courses https://alta3.com/courses?&category=AI&search  

### **How This Project Started**  
After testing **eight different ideas** with Grok, I finally settled on an approach and asked it to generate a basic economic simulator. I was inspired by Elon Musk's demo, where he got Grok to create an **Asteroids-style game from a single prompt**â€”so I challenged Grok to write an **economy simulator that runs entirely in the browser**.  

Why **only in the browser**?  
- **Privacy:** No one has to worry about their data being stored or analyzed by a serverâ€”it's all local.  
- **Accessibility:** No installs, no backend dependenciesâ€”just open a browser and run the simulation.  

To my surprise, **Grok nailed it on the first try**â€”the initial version "just worked." I kept refining it, prompting Grok to add features and tweak the logic. This repo is the result of that iterative process.
